# Data Persistence Fix - Food Truck Live

**A product of Energe Financial Corp LLC**

## Issue Resolved ✅

**Problem:** Sample data wasn't staying on screen across page refreshes and navigation. Featured trucks section wasn't displaying.

**Root Cause:** The `average_rating` and `total_reviews` columns on the `food_trucks` table weren't being calculated automatically when reviews were inserted.

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. Created Automatic Rating Calculation System

**Migration:** `update_truck_ratings_on_review`

**What it does:**
- Automatically calculates `average_rating` and `total_reviews` for each truck
- Updates whenever a review is added, modified, or deleted
- Keeps truck statistics always in sync with actual review data

**Technical Details:**
- Created `update_food_truck_ratings()` function
- Added 3 triggers: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on reviews table
- Updated all existing trucks with current ratings

### 2. Verified Database Persistence

**Current Database State:**
```
✅ 6 Food Trucks Created
✅ All trucks are ACTIVE (is_active = true)
✅ All trucks have GPS locations
✅ 18 Reviews total (3 per truck)
✅ Ratings: 4.67 - 5.0 stars
✅ Featured trucks threshold met (4.0+ stars, 1+ review)
```

### 3. Featured Trucks Now Display

**Top 3 Featured Trucks:**
1. Sushi Roll - 5.0 stars (3 reviews)
2. Thai Street Kitchen - 5.0 stars (3 reviews)
3. Taco Paradise - 4.67 stars (3 reviews)

All qualify for featured section and will display prominently!

## How Data Persistence Works Now

### On Page Load:
1. App queries `food_trucks` table with locations
2. Data includes `average_rating` and `total_reviews`
3. Featured trucks component filters trucks with 4.0+ stars
4. Top 3 are displayed in featured section
5. All 6 trucks appear on map

### On Page Refresh:
✅ Data persists (stored in Supabase database)
✅ Featured section appears immediately
✅ All 6 trucks visible on map
✅ No data loss

### On Navigation:
✅ Data stays in database
✅ Customer dashboard reloads trucks from DB
✅ Owner dashboard shows owner's truck
✅ Admin dashboard shows all trucks

### When New Reviews Added:
✅ Trigger automatically recalculates ratings
✅ Featured section updates if needed
✅ Truck statistics stay accurate

## Database Schema

### food_trucks table
- `average_rating`: Calculated from all reviews (0-5 scale)
- `total_reviews`: Count of all reviews for truck
- Updated automatically via trigger

### reviews table
- Each INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE triggers rating recalculation
- Ensures data is always accurate and current
