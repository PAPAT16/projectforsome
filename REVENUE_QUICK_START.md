## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: When will AdSense start showing ads?**
A: After your site is approved (1-3 days), ads appear immediately.

**Q: Do I need Stripe to test premium subscriptions?**
A: For production yes, but the UI works without it. Payments just won't process.

**Q: How do sponsored placements work without Stripe?**
A: They create database records immediately (for demo). Add Stripe for real payments.

**Q: Can I customize ad placements?**
A: Yes! Edit `CustomerDashboard.tsx` and use the `<AdBanner>` component anywhere.

**Q: What if customers complain about ads?**
A: That's the perfect upsell! Ads motivate premium subscriptions.
