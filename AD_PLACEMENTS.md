  SUM(CASE WHEN impression_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as clicks,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN impression_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as ctr,
  SUM(estimated_revenue) as revenue
FROM ad_impressions
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY ad_unit_id
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```

```sql
-- Daily ad revenue
SELECT
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as impressions,
  SUM(estimated_revenue) as revenue
FROM ad_impressions
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

```sql
-- Ad performance by page
SELECT
  page_location,
  COUNT(*) as impressions,
  AVG(estimated_revenue) as avg_revenue_per_impression
